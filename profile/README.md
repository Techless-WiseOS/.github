## We believe technology is a gift – an incredibly powerful one.

It has the potential to bring us together, keep us connected, and free up space, so we can deepen relationships and invest in people.

But, for many of us, this power has been hijacked.

Flashing screens feed dopamine highs. Instant gratification destroys discipline. A thousand shades of explicit content enslave our brains (and, often, the helpless victims involved). And the very device meant to delight and support us has taken us captive. It screams for more, and we oblige.

On top of this, our data is being used, abused, and exposed. Our homes and children are overcome by uninvited influences. Our self-control is taxed by the endless stream of brain chemicals. Our self-esteem has plunged into a black hole of bullying and comparison.

And our relationships are suffering.

We find ourselves over-indulging, keeping secrets, and turning away from the people we love - the people we so desperately need.

How is it that the more we consume, the more we are consumed? And the more connected we are, the more disconnected we find ourselves? Is it addiction? Compulsion? Gluttony? Sin? Brain chemistry? Manipulation by big tech?

Whatever it is, we need a break. We need space to breathe; a release from the onslaught; a chance to look up.

That’s why at Techless, we are harnessing the power of technology—to bring technology back to life.
